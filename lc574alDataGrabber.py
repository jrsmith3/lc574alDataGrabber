  Write data from the LeCroy LC574AL oscilloscope over GPIB-USB to a file.

  This program uses the Prologix GPIB-USB controller (prologix.biz) to communicate with the LeCroy LC574AL oscilloscope, collect the trace data from all of the input channels, and write it to a file. This program was written because of the unacceptably slow speed of data transfer via RS232. The scope of this program is very narrow: it is a drop-in replacement for manually collecting trace data from the scope over RS232 during the typical workflow of creating marks on a sample with the pulse generator. This program does no initialization of equipment and thus assumes trace data has been collected by the oscilloscope and is ready for transfer. This program would typically be run at the end of a spectroscopy scan, after the STM image data has been saved and after the STOP button has been pressed on the oscilloscope.

  Data is collected from all input channels, regardless of what (if anything) is plugged into them. The data is saved as a python pickle so that it is trivial to access it from a python program later on. No parsing is done on the data collected from the oscilloscope: the data is trnasferred from the oscilloscope as text strings, and this program does minimal structuring of the returned strings into a series of nested python dictionaries. At the root level of the dictionary are five fields, one with key "idn" that stores a string containing the *IDN? response of the oscilloscope, adn four with keys "C1" ... "C4" containing dictionaries of trace data for channels 1 through 4. The trace dictionaries contain three fields: "wavedesc", "trigtime", and "simple". Each contains a string taken from the oscilloscope that has been returned from the corresponding query. For example, the wavedesc key for the channel C1 contains the string read from the oscilloscope after writing the 'C1:INSP? "WAVEDESC"' query to the oscilloscope.

  This program automatically saves the data to a file in the present directory using the standard format: YYYYMMDD-HHMM_lc574al_intermediate_<sample name>_<experimenter initials>.dat
  
  This program is called from the command line and takes no arguments.
